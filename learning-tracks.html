        <p>Leveraging my experience as a product designer, I established a structured design process to help us meet our deadlines efficiently. Before my arrival, the organization's design process was inconsistent, leading to difficulties in problem comprehension and coordination on potential solutions within the development team. My approach brought clarity and organization, enabling the team to align more effectively on project goals.</p>

          <p>To facilitate better communication about the new product with the CEO and the development team, I began creating design user stories that included detailed flow diagrams. This approach enabled us to have quick, focused discussions, aligning everyone on the project objectives and ensuring that both design and development were in sync. As a result, we achieved a more cohesive understanding of what we were creating and developing. </p>

Given our customers' high level of engagement with the product, obtaining responses was relatively straightforward.</p>

        <p>One challenge I identified while working with a small design and development team was the occurrence of inconsistencies during the transition from design to development. To address this, I led discussions with the team and spearheaded the creation of our first UI Pattern Library, ensuring greater consistency throughout the application.  This library is still in use today.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
   <p>Learning Tracks was successfully adopted by major organizations, including Airbnb and Eventbrite. Both their learning departments and employees were highly impressed with the design and user experience of Continu. <br/>

During a conversation with Continu's CEO in the midst of the pandemic, he shared that the company was experiencing tremendous success. Leading companies like Slack, Lyft, Grubhub, GoPro, and Shopify had implemented Learning Tracks to streamline employee training, onboarding, and best practices for remote work.<br/>

I was pleased to learn that Continu continues to use the original UI/UX patterns I designed. The CEO also mentioned that when HR executives are surveyed on why they chose Continu over competitors, they consistently cite the "Excellent User Experience and Clean User Interface."  </p>
